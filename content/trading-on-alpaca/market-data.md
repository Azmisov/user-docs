Consolidated stock market data is an aggregated reporting of all securities exchanges’ and alternative trading venues’
quote and trade data. It is the most relied upon type of market data, providing investors and traders globally with a
unified view of U.S. stock market prices and volumes. It also underpins the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO), which
provides investors with a continuous view of the best available displayed buy and sell prices, and through Rule 611
ensures that investors receive the best available displayed prices on their trades, with a few exceptions.
